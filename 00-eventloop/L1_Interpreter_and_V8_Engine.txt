Interpreted => A compiled program doesn't work everywhere.
-> Interpreted code are written once and run everywhere.
-> Must have a runtime, node.exe
-> Node.exe is compiled program for every OS/CPU.
Compiled => ** Whatever code is written, needs to be translated into something that the CPU understands(that is machine code) -> this is called compiling
-> Convert code into instructions.
-> Linking(all those files need to be linked to run) creates executable file.
-> So, compiling produces machine code in form of object files, Each object file may present a source file,
Object files are not ready to be run, they need to be linked and create an executable

=>> Linking: Linkers creates an executable file, Finds and links all object files required and create one file. The file is an "exeecutable"

Machine Code => specific to the CPU, Each CPU has different instructions set

High Level Languages: Abstractions to hide complexity. Need to compile for a CPU. Compile turns code to machine code. Linking creates executable file.

===>> Interpreted Languages are slow, So v8 comes into picture
JIT(Just in Time Compilation)
I'm interpreting this code a lot, Let me compile it directly to machine code.
Put it on the heap, Mark memory as executable , point the CPU program counter it.

===>> Garbage Collection.
Node(v8) implement it as part of code
Garbage collectin is part of the runtime,Tags every object and tracks it.

====>> V8 Engine
-> The primary objective is to exucute the JavaScript code outside of a web browser environment with high performance and efficiency.
-> Performance Optimization: V8 employs advanced techniques, such as Just-In-Time compilation, to optimize code execution at runtime.
-> Javascript -->> Bytecode (faster)
-> Mark & Sweep Garbage Collection: Sweep everything and mark everything that is not in use and at the end remove that is not required.
-> Efficient heap memory management: JS is dynamically typed, we don't know how large objects are, makes it slow, to counter this V8 helps again.
-> V8 stores primitive data types in the stack
-> Objects and Arrays are stored in the heap. Both are treated as objects.
-> Inline caching.

-->> Inline Caching: What v8 engine does is that first they run the function normally as you would expect. But, after some time when the functin is called repeadtedly, they assume
or they act smart and just equals the repeated function calls to what the function returns to save time and improve the efficiency or speed. This is called Inline-caching.
Ths gist of this whole inline caching is to write better and efficient code knowing how the code will be processed by the engine.

==>> v8 has 2 compilers, Full-Codegen & Crankshaft.
1. Full-Codegen:- parses js directly to machine code, without an intermediary language, allowing it to begin execution sooner.
2. Crankshaft:- A JIT compiler, optimizes code for hot methods. this means that in the same v8 program, different levels of optimized code co-exists at the same time.
