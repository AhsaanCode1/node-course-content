-> Why do we have the event-loop
1. Node Execution:
It's a C++ program, 
The first input is a JS file,
Node reads the file and interpret the JS,
JS code is executed line by line serially untill it is done.

------Event Loop---------
-> Single Thread
-> Asynchronous Non-blocking I/O
-> A loop with phases
-> Each phase has queue of callbacks
-> Terminates when there is no callbacks left 
* A callback is a piece of code in JS, that is triggered after a specific event is tatisfied.
 
 ## Summary
 1. The first input is a js file, Node reads the file and execute the js
 2. After the execution Node starts a loop, Execution can register callbacks.
 3. Callbacks can register more callbacks
