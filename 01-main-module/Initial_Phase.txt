Initial phase runs only once.
---Main Module----
-> All main code execute synchronously
-> No callbacks can get executed
-> Main loop not yet initialized
-> Main Module / Initial phase
-> Runs Once!

-------------------
-> Modules are resolved/ loaded first
-> Code executed first
-> All require/import module are loaded
(require: is a part of the original, synchronous CommonJS module system.
import: is part of the newer, asynchronous ES Modules(ESM) standard.
The choice between the 2 impacts how modules are loaded and where they can be used in your code.
)

-> Before running any of the main module
-> There are Modules that load other modules
